# Final Project
<p>In my bachelors, I took a web development course teaching us the basics of HTML and CSS. At the end of the semester we were asked to create a web site.</p>
<p>My web site was created to introduce new players to Dungeons and Dragons. The files in this repository include all the files used to create this web site.</p>
