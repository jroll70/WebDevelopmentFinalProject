            <h1>Gather your Party and Gear</h1>
            <p>Now that you know the basics of playing, it's time to gather the neccessary tools to play and the people to play with.
            </p>
            <p> Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game that aims to take you on adventures in worlds of your creation or 
                through ones you've heard of in the past. This site aims to introduce you to Dungeons and Dragons and how you can 
                participate in an adventure of your own, whether you want to play through the adventure or be the one who tells the story.
            </p>
            <section class="media">
                <h2>Gear</h2>
                    <p>As a new player, Dungeons and Dragons can look like a very complicated and confusing game to start, not to mention 
                        expensive. I recommend spending little to no money to get started so that before you buy a ton of stuff that won't 
                        be used, you can see if you like the game or not. Luckily, there are tons of ways to play the game for free or for very cheap.
                    </p>
                    <p>The cheapest and most well rounded way to start would be to buy the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/dungeons-38-dragons-dragons-of-stormwreck-isle-starter-set-game/-/A-85017140?ref=tgt_adv_xsp&AFID=google&fndsrc=tgtao&DFA=71700000012732838&CPNG=PLA_Toys%2BShopping_Local%7CToys_Ecomm_Hardlines&adgroup=SC_Toys&LID=700000001170770pgs&LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&network=g&device=c&location=9008554&targetid=pla-378621605173&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1248099&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwu-63BhC9ARIsAMMTLXTSorfW_POkaI5XQxCRmHfBK_OUzo0yo3bMaSsdf0hGt5vkBKhKAXEaAiYPEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" class="link">
                       Dungeons and Dragons Starter Set.</a> I reccommend this because 
                        it comes with all of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A full adventure that explains to the GM how to run it, and it's geared towards new players</li>
                            <li>The basic rule set and how to level characters up until level 3</li>
                            <li>Premade characters with their sheets</li>
                            <li>A set of dice</li>
                        </ul>
                      

                    <p>  All of this is only $15 and can be bought at target or online. With such low price you can see if Dungeons and Dragons is something you wantto keep 
                        up with.

                <h2>Places to Play</h2>
                    <p>Dungeons and Dragons is fun anyway it can be played, playing in person is great if you have a group of friends who can easily gather together 
                        and play, but not all groups are like this. Luckily we live in a digital age and there are plenty of options for playing online with your friends.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Roll 20</h3>
                    <p>The most popular way to play online at the moment is through a website called <a href="https://roll20.net/" class="link">"Roll20"</a> You can create campaigns yourself or use some of the materials already stored on
                         the website to play. The materials provided will cost money but will normally include all materials needed to run an official campaign like the one included
                         in the starter set. This website will allow you to play as if you are in person providing a gameboard and character tokens that can all be customized</p>
                    <h3>DND Beyond</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" class="link">DND Beyond</a> is the offical website for Dungeons and Dragons, it contains ways to create characters for free and even ways to digitially roll dice. In the past,
                        there were no ways to play the game pn this site, but recently their own platform to play is being tested and is expected to be released
                         publically in the near future. This will be the simplest way to gain access to official content and keep all of your characters housed in the same place.
                         content to the game in the future. If you buy a campaign digitally or a new rulebook, you will be able to use these in a virtual campaign. They are 
                         also planning to let you create your own custom campaigns and 3D gameboards!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Local Game Store</h3>
                    <p>If you really want to play in person but don't have a group close by, look at your local gamestores and see if they have an active campaign or if they are running the official continuous campaign 
                        called "Adventurer's League".
