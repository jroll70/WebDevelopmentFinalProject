            <h1>Play as a Character</h1>
            <p> Playing as a character in Dungeons and Dragons gives you the opportunity to create a character you have always wanted to adventure with. 
                There are nearly limitless ways to play as a character, but in the most basic form, gameplay looks like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interact with players and non-playable characters or the environment</li> 
                <li>Roll dice to determine success in interactions</li> 
                <li>Apply the outcome of interactions</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Though that is the main gameplay of how a player will play the game, it all has to start somewhere,
                and that start is character creation. Character creation will help start a base
                for how well a player will perform in interactions based on specific skills given to the 
                character in creation.
            </p>

                <h2>Character Creation</h2>
                    <p>As previously mentioned, character creation will determine your abilities and inturn is what
                        influences your rolls during interactions. During character creation you will decide many things
                        such as species (previously known as race), class, background, and appearance.  
                    </p>

                    <p>Previous iterations of Dungeons and Dragons had race rather than species and race played a big part
                        in deciding what to play as because each race had different abilities assigned to them. The current 
                        version of Dungeons and Dragons has changed that by making all Species have the same benefit of being
                        able to choose ability specilizations. Class is now the biggest determining ability score factor.

                    </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Classes</h2>
                    <p>Classes determine the occupation of the created character and dictate the specialization. When thinking 
                        of famous fantasy characters, you can break that character down to what their class would be in Dungeons 
                        and Dragons. Take Gandalf from *Lord of the Rings* as an example—Gandalf would be a wizard! This will be 
                        the most important decision you make in character creation because it will help you determine which abilities 
                        to invest in. A breakdown of classes and their main abilities can be found below.

                <h2>Abilities</h2>
                    <p>After reading through this page I'm sure you want a breakdown of what an "Ability" is.
                        In Dungeons and Dragons, abilites are what determine how good or bad you are at something.
                        There are 6 abilities in total that can have a value between 1 and 20, 1 meaing you are very bad
                        and 20 meaning you are very good. The following are the abilities and what they effect:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strength - How Physically Strong you are</li>
                        <li>Dexterity - How agile a character is</li>
                        <li>Constitution - Overall health and physical capability</li>
                        <li>Intelligence - How smart a character is in regards to book smarts</li>
                        <li>Wisdom - Smart in practicality terms, street smarts</li>
                        <li>Charisma - Force of your personality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So a character with a strength of 16 would be able to lift heavy objects much easier than another with 
                        a strength of 1. 
                    </p>
                    <p>After chosing your class, you will determine what skills are important to that class and you will assign abilities based on importance.
                        There are a number of ways to determine ability score and everryone has there preference. the two main ways are to either roll dice
                        and determine the ability number by adding the dice up, another way is point buy where you increasae abilities from 10 until you run
                        out of alloted points to spend.  
                    </p>
